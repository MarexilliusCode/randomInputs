# Download all .py files to work

## RandomInputs.py
This file's purpose is to activate the program to make everything work.

## GamesInfo.py
This file is to insert input lists and dictionnaries for games and consoles. 

If you want to add an input list, you must make or copy a new input list for the game and add both the list and a name for it in the "gameList" dictionnary found at the end of the code.

## ButtonVariables.py
This file is just to have variables of most keyboard keys as variables across the file. Not much to modify here.
